Hello World!! Welcome to my new blog! I've read other bloggers off and on for a few years, and I have been trying to figure out what it takes to be a good blogger. I think the key to it all is just to have something to say. Anyways, I'll spend most of my time talking about various nerdy things like tech, stocks, the latest gadget that I bought, but also about sports and other fun activities.

Just a quick introduction. My name is Jimmy, and I love technology. I love reading about it, watching videos, doing tutorials, and most of all I enjoy building something cool that I can talk about. I am currently an Architect at Booz Allen. If you are looking for a new gig, let me know ;). We are ALWAYS hiring and with the AMZNpocalypse coming to Northern Virginia in a year or two, we'll need all of the good men and women we can get. For real though, if you want a referral, hit me up.
