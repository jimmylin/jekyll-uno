Happy Thanksgiving!! Here is a list of things I am thankful for:
- Friends and Family
- My amazing (yet often stressful) job
- My (perhaps questionable) health
- Volleyball and all of the friends that I have been able to make playing it
- The freedom that is provided to me from the country that I love and also the people who protect us
- Time to spend with the people list above
- The highs and lows (reminds you how much better the highs are) of the last year
- The support that I got this year that helped me get in better shape
- All of the amazing things that I learned this year (I feel like a stronger person. Still tons to learn, but I feel improved each day)
- Lastly, my reconnection with the Lord and the love and grace that he places on me

I'm sure I missed a ton of things. I sometimes laugh when people say their hearts are full, but I truly feel this way this year. I pray that it continues and that I can continue to grow into the person that God wants me to be.
